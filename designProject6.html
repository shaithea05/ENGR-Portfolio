                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Project 6 - Iteration</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project6/needs.jpeg" alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    After we initially defined our problem and came up with a few solutions, we began to
                                    delve deeper to really flush out our final solution in order to create a
                                    deliverable. This involved creating the following needs statement:
                                <h6>Blind dogs need a way to navigate so that they can be safe and independent.</h6>
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project5/muffinsHalo.jpeg"
                                    alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    Once we had our need statement, we moved on to defining some of the Design
                                    Principles and key features that we want our product to address. We defined them as
                                    follows:
                                </p>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Customizable Measurement</b> — We want to be able to measure specific dogs and
                                    customize our design to fit many different dogs
                                    since nose size can vary from dog to dog
                                    even if they are the same breed. We want to include clear instructions on how to
                                    measure the dog
                                    and what to measure to create the best fit.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Sturdy</b> —We want the product to be able to withstand forceful impacts, without
                                    moving around too much, and being not likely to break
                                    as the dog moves around.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Removable</b> —We want this produc to be able to come off with some ease if it
                                    gets stuck on something. We do not want to choke or hurt the dog.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Comfort</b> -We do not want this product to cause too much discomfort. Rather we
                                    want it to allow dogs to continue their
                                    way
                                    of life without the product acting as a burden. We expect it to have a learning
                                    curve that allows
                                    the dog
                                    to eventually use the product properly and comfortably.
                                </li>
                                <p>
                                    With these things in mind, we decided that for us success would look like a halo
                                    product that does not break under a heavy impact. In order to do that, we had to
                                    order a few different materials and resources which are linked <a
                                        href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jggXgD1h9Pz74lPPZ1Hh-u_tCgPx0u0ALmFqtUNRgUI/edit?usp=sharing'>HERE</a>.
                                    Once we
                                    completed all of this planning, we moved onto prototyping our product.
                                </p>

                                    Prototyping is an iterative process that involves designing, building, testing, and
                                    refining prototypes in order to improve ideas and identify potential issues before
                                    finalizing a product design. Prototyping allows for experimentation, learning, and
                                    improvement, ultimately leading to the development of a successful and optimized
                                    final product. As we worked toward creating this open-source design, we began our
                                    prototyping process to finalize our Computer-aided design (CAD).

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    To begin the prototyping process we took inspiration from the already existing
                                    designs: Muffin’s Halo and the Sierra Safety Hoop. Based on these designs we started
                                    our first iteration and drew a horseshoe-like shape that we would attach to a
                                    harness. This was a very rough sketch of what we envisioned for our design, but it
                                    got the idea across for us to begin moving onto actually sketching it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With our idea fresh in our minds, we moved on to Fusion360 to draw our CAD and print
                                    our first prototype. We had some trouble working with Fusion360, but we used our
                                    knowledge from previous assignments (the laser box design) and created the
                                    screenshot you may see below. We started this design with a circle sketch, and then
                                    extruded it. Once we had this 3-dimensional circle, we cut it in half, and added a
                                    rectangle on its edge. We then extruded the rectangle and added a hole in the middle
                                    of it to mimic the initial blueprint of our product. Then, using our previous
                                    project experience, we mirrored half of the design to the other side of the y axis
                                    to complete our design.
                                </p>

                                    This initial print came out pretty well. It was very sturdy, but also very bulky.
                                    The measurements were not great, but it had the general shape. After assessing our
                                    initial print, we identified areas for improvement. While the prototype was sturdy,
                                    its bulkiness created challenges in terms of the practicality of our product and its
                                    aesthetics. We realized that we needed to refine the measurements in order to ensure
                                    a better general and enhance the overall design. We also recognized the need for
                                    parameters as we wanted this design to be adaptable to different dogs. Returning to
                                    Fusion 360, we revised our model, incorporating insights from our evaluation of our
                                    first print.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This time, in our revised CAD design, we implemented parameters on key dimensions in
                                    order to introduce flexibility when adjusting the product to different dogs. We also
                                    chose to create a more elliptical shape to optimize the form for aesthetics.
                                    Moreover, we strategically reduced the thickness of the halo component to mitigate
                                    the overall bulkiness of our product, achieving a more streamlined and sleek
                                    appearance without compromising structural integrity. These adjustments reflected
                                    our commitment to continuous refinement and innovation, ensuring that our final
                                    product would meet the demands of both functionality and comfortable aesthetics
                                </p>

                                    This print was unsuccessful the first time as it had fallen off of the magnetic
                                    Prusa plate. After further inspection, we had come to the conclusion that the plate
                                    itself had too many oils on it from people handling it, and we wiped it down with
                                    some alcohol. After prepping the plate, we put it back and reprinted our design.
                                    Unfortunately, we came across the same issue where our design would not fully print.
                                    Based on this error, we increased the width of our halo so that we could reduce the
                                    impact of any collisions. Additionally, we did not have access to a dog that we
                                    could test our product on so we printed a mini dog print along with a mini version
                                    of our improved product.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/assets/project6/dogPrint.jpeg" alt="..." />
                                <p>
                                    own version of a small harness for our mini dog print and used it to attach the Halo
                                    with velcro. In our life sized design, we planned for the velcro to be tied around
                                    to minimize the chances of dogs taking them off themselves; however with the scaling
                                    of this print, we had to use the sticky aspect of the velcro to attach the Halo to
                                    our dog. We liked this design and felt that it would be sturdy enough to face
                                    different strengths of impacts, but we wanted to try printing another iteration of
                                    our design with curved parts of the ellipses in order to better take the impact.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With this latest print we felt that by making the design have more curves, the force
                                    of any impact would be distributed better and result in less whiplash for the dog
                                    wearing the Halo. Unfortunately, this design did not print properly, but we want to
                                    continue working on improving our design to make a usable open source design.
